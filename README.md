# Data-analysis
This project examines YouTube advertising activity of Indian companies between 2021 and 2024, with a specific focus on identifying ads featuring celebrity endorsements. As digital marketing becomes increasingly central to brand promotion, YouTube serves as a key platform for companies to reach consumers. Celebrity endorsements, known for boosting visibility and brand credibility, play a significant role in these campaigns.
In this regard, the project utilizes the YouTube Data API, which retrieves data from the official YouTube channels of each selected company. The following information is extracted during the analysis: the company name, date of publication, and links to the advertisements. Special attention is given to filtering unofficial or user-generated content by only taking into consideration advertisements published by the companies themselves. The system also uses keywords and other methods to identify possible celebrity endorsements in the ads.
This study aims to draw from insight on how Indian companies have positioned YouTube for advertising in these three years, with the purpose of ascertaining the role that celebrity endorsement has played in their digital marketing strategies. This will allow one to understand if the celebrity-driven campaigns are a common feature and whether they stayed influential in brand recall between 2021 and 2024.
